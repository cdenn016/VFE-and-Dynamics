"""
Validation Test: Pointwise Spatial Emergence
=============================================

Verifies that meta-agent emergence is truly POINTWISE:
1. Consensus computed at each spatial location independently
2. Connected components found where consensus holds
3. Disconnected consensus regions → separate meta-agents
4. Single region of consensus → single meta-agent

This test uses REAL KL divergence, not mocks.
